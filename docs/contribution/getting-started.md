## Contribution Guide

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! Your contributions are valuable and help improve the overall quality of the project. Before you start, please follow these simple steps:

### Step 1: Read the GitHub Issues

Check the project's GitHub repository for any open issues. Issues marked with an "open" flag are available for contributors. Review the issues to find a task or feature you would like to work on.

### Step 2: Express Interest

If you find an issue that you would like to work on, comment on the issue expressing your interest in contributing. This allows the maintainers to coordinate efforts and avoid duplication of work.

### Step 3: Confirmation from Maintainer

Once you express interest, wait for confirmation from the project maintainer. The maintainer will review your interest and either approve or provide guidance on the issue.

### Step 4: Branching

If the maintainer approves your contribution, follow the [branching document](/contribution/branching) rules to create a new branch for your work. This helps keep the main branch clean and organized.

### Step 5: Work on the Contribution

Make the necessary changes and improvements in your branch. Ensure that your code adheres to the project's coding standards and guidelines.

### Step 6: Create a Pull Request

Once your contribution is ready, create a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the main project. Provide a clear and concise description of the changes you made and the problem you solved.

### Step 7: Review

The maintainers will review your pull request and may provide feedback or request further changes. Be responsive to these comments and make any necessary adjustments.

### Step 8: Merge

Once your pull request passes review and all issues are addressed, the maintainers will merge your changes into the main project. Congratulations, you've successfully contributed to the project!

Thank you for your contribution! Your efforts are highly appreciated. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers or the community.
